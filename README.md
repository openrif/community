Issue tracker
------

Please use the issue tracker for this repository for starting any issue related to the VIVO-ISF Data Standard. Unless your issues is directly related to one of the other repositories, and it doesn't need community input or discussion, your issue should start as an issue in this GitHub repository. It can then continue in one of the other repositories as needed. The reason for doing this is to minimize what the general community needs to track here on GitHub, and to limit the exposure to more lower-level discussions that usually occur in the other repositories.
